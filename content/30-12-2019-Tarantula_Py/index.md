TarantulaPy is a correlation-based fault localization technique that uses the coverage information and stats from test cases to rank the lines of code of a Python program in terms of susceptibility to bug(s). For more confidence in the results, the program elicits a high number of test cases. 
Since most new programmers start their careers in Python, tools such as TarantulaPy can provide them with valuable insights into the probable causes of errors.
