Developed a PlantsvZombies like game in Unity game engine backed by C# code. I incorporated opensource Pokemon sprites instead of the regular plants and zombies. Every Pokemon was assigned a single attack such as all water Pokemon would shoot water in a single direction. The user could plant their Pokemon (just like PlantsvZombies) to protect their base against Team Rocket's Pokemon.

I also integrated Vuforia API to provide augmented reality functionality.
