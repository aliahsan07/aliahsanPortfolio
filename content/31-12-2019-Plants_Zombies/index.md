I designed this game in Unity game engine using opensource Pokemon sprites to create a Plants v Zombies like combat functionality in which you can plant your favorite Pokemon to defend your gym against the incoming evil Pokemon. Vuforia API was integrated to provide augmented reality to the end-users.
